Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?
    The test ran at 0.000s, but since theres an if statement, the runtime complexity is linear at 0(n)

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?
    O(n) there are 2 variables

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
    Test ran at 0.000s, but with a for and nested if statement, the runtime complexity is linear at 0(2n)

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
    O(1) - there is 1 variable

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    Runtime at 7+ seconds, 0(n^2) - quadratic complexity 2 nested for loops

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    O(1) - only 1 variable

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    Runtime at 1.12s, 0(2n) - a for loop with a nested if statement

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    O(1) - only 1 variable
